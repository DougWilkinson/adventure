# This is a test file for github training
# Add something below

# This line is part of the branch called "dougs-test"
# I can push this as a new branch to be reviewed before 
# commit to master branch

# This is a new test using a fresh directory on my mac
# ran git clone from command line and then opened the folder
# from vscode.
# edited while master was selected, going to try to create a new
# branch

# suppose I made this one last change, can I push that to git as a commit?
